These groups explicitly state their opposition to LGBT rights (including same-sex marriage, prohibitions on employment discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, and prohibitions on so-called “conversion therapy” or “reparative therapy” that seeks to ‘correct’ queer people). Many of these groups also advocate or lobby for religious exemptions to legal protections for the LGBT community, and promote or engage in anti-LGBT rhetoric. Leaders of these groups have said, for example, that Satan is the architect of same-sex marriage. Many, but not all, of these groups have been included in lists of anti-LGBT “hate groups” compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center in the US.
