These groups have been listed as partners of an ultra-conservative network called the World Congress of Families (WCF). This network has been described as an anti-LGBT “hate group” and an “[incubator for extremism](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/revealed-dozens-of-european-politicians-linked-to-us-incubator-for-extremism/)”. openDemocracy has exposed WCF’s growing connections to far-right leaders across Europe. Founded after a meeting of US and Russian ultra-conservatives in 1997, it has held global and regional gatherings from Hungary to Ghana. It promotes what it calls “traditional families” or “natural families”, which are composed exclusively of a married man and woman and their biological children, as many as she can give birth to. It positions everything else (including same-sex couples, single parents and multi-generational households) as grave “unnatural” threats to society.
