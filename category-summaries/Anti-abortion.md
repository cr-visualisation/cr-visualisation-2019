These groups explicitly state their opposition to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including access to abortion, emergency contraception, hormonal birth control, in vitro fertilisation and other types of comprehensive reproductive healthcare. They often express the view that human life begins at the moment of conception (when a fertilised embryo is implanted in the uterine wall) or at the moment of fertilisation (when a sperm has penetrated an egg). These groups advocate or lobby for legal restrictions on access to abortion and other types of reproductive healthcare. Some of these groups have also been connected to [misinformation](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/trump-linked-religious-extremists-global-disinformation-pregnant-women/) and manipulative tactics including shopfront ‘crisis pregnancy centres’ and websites that seek to reach women considering abortions, and stop them.
