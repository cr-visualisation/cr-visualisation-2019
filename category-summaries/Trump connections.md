These groups have significant connections to the Trump administration. These include former staffers going to work for Trump, and Trump nominees for official office coming from these organisations. The chief counsel for the American Centre for Law and Justice, for example, is one of Trumpâ€™s personal lawyers. Other connections include funding from the Trump administration (or the family foundations of Trump cabinet members) to some groups, and repeated or regular meetings between Trump officials and representatives of these organisations. Board members of some groups have made significant campaign contributions to Trump-connected political action committees or have links to Trump and his inner circle through their corporate day jobs.
