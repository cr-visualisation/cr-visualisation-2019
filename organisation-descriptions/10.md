This group's stated mission is to “advance faith, family, and freedom in public policy and the culture from a biblical worldview”. It has been described as an anti-LGBT “hate group”. Its president has [linked homosexuality to paedophilia](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/frc-scientists-refuse-to-accept-clear-correlation-between-homosexuality-and-pedophilia/), and said the [legalisation of same-sex marriage](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/revolution-anti-gay-activists-threaten-uprising-if-supreme-court-approves-marriage-equality/) would “break this country [the US] apart”. Its campaign ‘Pray, Vote, Stand’ ahead of the US elections praises Trump’s record on “family and international religious freedom”. It’s also been a partner of the anti-LGBT and anti-abortion World Congress of Families.
