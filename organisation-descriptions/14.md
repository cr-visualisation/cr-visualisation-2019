Founded in 1977, this group runs [campaigns](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v%3D3975459085815714) against abortion in the US and supports anti-abortion ‘crisis pregnancy centres’. It has also been a partner of the anti-LGBT World Congress of Families. It has been called one of the main "groups which help drive the religious right’s anti-gay crusade”. In early 2020, Jenna Ellis, who once worked for the group’s founder James Dobson, was [appointed](https://www.advocate.com/politics/2020/1/09/new-trump-adviser-jenna-ellis-homophobe-who-said-gays-deserve-hiv) Trump’s campaign legal advisor. Dobson himself has spoken out against Trump’s impeachment and celebrated his anti-abortion and pro-Israel positions.
