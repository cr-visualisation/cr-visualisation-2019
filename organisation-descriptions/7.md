This group was established in 1996 “to create disciples of Jesus Christ in the political arena throughout the world”. Its founder [leads](https://www.hrc.org/news/mike-pence-sponsors-white-house-bible-study-led-by-anti-lgbtq-anti-women-ex) Bible study sessions for Republican lawmakers and Trump cabinet members. He has also [defended](https://theintercept.com/2018/06/19/capitol-ministries-trump-family-separation/) the Trump administration’s controversial child separation policies on the Mexico border calling them a consequence of immigrants’ “illegal behaviour”. The group’s leaders [have called](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/magazine/ralph-drollinger-white-house-evangelical.html) homosexuality “an abomination” and “illegitimate in God’s eyes” and abortion a ‘slippery slope’ to infanticide.
