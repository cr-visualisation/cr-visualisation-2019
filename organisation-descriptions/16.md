This group was co-founded in 1983 by a Baptist minister and the current CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom (also in this database). It has opposed any kind of homeschool regulations, arguing that they could give states “virtually unlimited power” over children (who belong to their parents). It’s opposed anti-discrimination laws and lobbied against same-sex marriage. It’s also been a partner of the World Congress of Families.
