This group focuses on training political activists and leaders – and says its previous trainees include Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president. It was founded in 1979 by Morton Blackwell, a special assistant to President Reagan who reportedly came up with the term “moral majority” in conversation with right-wing activist and televangelist Jerry Falwell. Speakers at its events have included an Italian far-right Lega party senator and the leader of a Spanish ultra-conservative group close to the far-right Vox party.
