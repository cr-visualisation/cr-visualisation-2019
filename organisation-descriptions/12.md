This group has been [called](https://www.pfaw.org/report/the-federalist-society-from-obscurity-to-power/%23footnote-39965-6) the “single most influential organisation in the conservative legal world” and “the [conservative pipeline](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/the-conservative-pipeline-to-the-supreme-court) to the Supreme Court”. Its aims have been [described](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/10/opinions/amy-coney-barrett-federalist-society-begala/index.html) as “tak[ing] control of your sex life, your family life, your economic rights, your voting rights”. A US senator [accused](https://medium.com/senator-sheldon-whitehouse/the-third-federalist-society-f8a3ff2e19fd) it of being funded by dark money via “massive, secret contributions from corporate right-wing groups that have big agendas before the courts”.
