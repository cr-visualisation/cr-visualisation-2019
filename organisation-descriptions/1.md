Founded in 1990 and based in Michigan, this group combines conservative Christianity with right-wing, free-market economics. Its donors include the Koch family and the DeVos family foundations of Trump’s education secretary. It’s been accused of seeking to “[undermine, maybe even bring down](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/how-pope-francis-became-hate-figure-far-right/)” Pope Francis. Its branch in Italy supported the (as yet unsuccessful) application of a group called Dignitatis Humanae Institute – of which Steve Bannon is a trustee – to set up a “gladiator school” for European culture warriors outside Rome.
