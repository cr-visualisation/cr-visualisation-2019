Founded in 1971, this Ohio-based group is a pioneer of so-called ‘crisis pregnancy centres’, which seek to stop women from accessing legal abortions. In early 2020, [openDemocracy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/trump-linked-religious-extremists-global-disinformation-pregnant-women/) revealed widespread “disinformation, emotional manipulation and outright deceit” at this group's affiliates around the world. Trump’s vice president Mike Pence has spoken at its events and the group has urged its allies to apply for funding from its “new friends in Washington”. It’s also been a partner of the World Congress of Families network.
